# NestJS-API-Rest
This project consists of an API that allows its users to sign up and log in, and work with its bookmarks, allowing them to create, search, edit, and delete them.

Technically it is implemented using the TypeScript language under the NestJS framework. It uses JWT for user authentication and various programming techniques such as Guards.

For the persistence of the information it uses a PostgreSQL database contained in Docker, with which it communicates through Prisma as ORM.

Lastly, it has been tested using Pactum.
